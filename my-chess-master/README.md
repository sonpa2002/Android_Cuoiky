The MyChess Android Chess App
==============================

<h3>What?</h3>

This project is meant to be a beginners practice in Android Studio for writing mobile applications.
Its structure is the one of a standard Android Studio project and it contains several layouts, Java files and - most importantly - a playable chess game where standard rules apply.
It should be noted, that the game is intended for two-player-use, as a chess AI would have rather overshot my current coding knowledge.

-------------------------------
<h3>Why?</h3>

As stated, I not only wanted to improve my coding skills (in java) but also wanted to get familiar with the concept of mobile - in this case android - development and as it seemed quite interesting to me, a small project would frankly be a good way to start, I thought.

-------------------------------
<h3>How?</h3>

Writing mostly Java, with the exception of some XML, I created multiple files, each for a different layout using intents.
The most tricky part was to program the chess game, so that is runs smooth, correct and the figures get moved accurately.
I created every single graphic (except the chess board and the figure icons) myself using Adobe Photoshop and implemented them with a constraint layout.

-------------------------------

<h4>-> How can I run the project?</h4>

You just have to download the files and open them in Android Studio. Then you either run a virtual emulator to test the app or you can pair your own Android device via Wifi and download the game there.
Additionally, under \app\build\outputs\apk\debug you can download the app-debug file to your phone and it should work too.
